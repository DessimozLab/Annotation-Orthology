In the subdirectory "pre-processing" you can find the jupyter notebook we used to choose the NCBI longest isoforms as well as a modified version of the OrthoFinder's original python script "primary_transcript" that will moreover output pickle files necessary for running the GSpTDBenchmark (This pickle files are already provided also in the GSpTDBenchmark/genetotranscripts subdirectory of the repo).

Moreover, there are also sample scripts for running OF in sampleOFscripts.
